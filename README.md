# Beginner Guide NodeMCU ESP8266 

**This is the famous NodeMCU which is based on ESP8266 WiFi SoC. This is version 3 and it is based on ESP-12E (An ESP8266 based WiFi module). NodeMCU is also an open-source firmware and development kit that helps you to prototype your IoT(Internet of Things) product within a few LUA script lines, and of course you can always program it with Arduino IDE.**

## Features:
  - Open-source
  - Interactive
  - Programmable
  - Low cost
  - Simple
  - Smart
  - WiFi enabled
  - Arduino-like hardware IO
  - Advanced API for hardware IO, which can dramatically reduce the redundant work for configuring and manipulating hardware
  - Code like Arduino, but interactively in Lua script
  - Nodejs style network API
  - Event-driven API for network applicaitons, which faciliates developers writing code running on a 5mm*5mm sized MCU in Nodejs style
  - Greatly speed up your IoT application developing process
  - Lowest cost WiFi
  - Less than $2 WiFi MCU ESP8266 integrated and esay to prototyping development kit
  - We provide the best platform for IoT application development at the lowest cost
  - Input Voltage:
    - 3.3V via 3.3V pin
    - 5.0V via Vin or USB


## Specifications:
  - The Development Kit based on ESP8266, integates GPIO, PWM, IIC, 1-Wire and ADC all in one board.
    - Power your development in the fastest way combinating with NodeMCU Firmware!
    - USB-TTL included, plug&play
    - 10 GPIO, every GPIO can be PWM, I2C, 1-wire
